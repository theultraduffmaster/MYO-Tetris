##Gesture Based UI Project

##Description
My project for this module will be to use the Myo Armband in the creation process of a Tetris game and use it as its 
main controller but it will also support normal Keyboard inputs. Made in C# using Visual Studio.

##Main Aim
To make a game fully synced (if possible) with the Myo Armband and have all (if not most) gestures doing something 
within the game. For example: Wave In will move a block to the left while Wave Out will move it to the right

##Gestures
######These are subject to change
Wave In: Move block left
Wave Out: Move block right
Fingers-Spread: Rotate left
Fist: Rotate right
Double-Tap: Increase Speed
